I don't like that you can't follow someone else's profile, they should really change that. Also, in my opinion they should also allow you to rate with a half star, like 6.5 stars. The way it works you can only give something a rating of 1-10. If you could follow other profiles I would give it 5 stars.",

It's just plain disrespectful lying to your intended audience and deliberately wasting ppl's time, which u can't buy more of... Can you? Lose the fake reviews üôè",

For example he showed me The Silence of the Lambs and that Michelle Pfeiffer was the original choice for the lead but turned it down and Jodie Foster went on to win an Oscar for it. It's still the site I use most to this day ever since.",
